The guys start with some follow-up on the iPhone 6 vs 6 Plus, then charge ahead into the challenges of iCloud Family Sharing, avoiding phone-killing updates, fun with quadcopters, and privacy. Along the way they discuss yeti hands, the dangers of cleverness, transcending iOS, and hybrid toast-cat perpetual motion generators.
