summary: "Potatowire, Bob, and Erik think out loud about note-taking. Along the way, they touch on Gabe's new app TapCellar, Bob's decision to sell his iPhone 6 Plus, minimizing platform-dependent apps, plain-text workflows on mobile, Dropbox, Drafts, Editorial, things we want to use vs. the things we actually use, Evernote, Byword, Potatowire-Flavored Markdown, Google Drive, hierarchies, Calca, Trello, fancy notebooks with fancy things in them, and breaking free of tool fetishism."
