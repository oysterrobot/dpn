summary: "Gabe triumphantly returns to Dawn Patrol as he, Potatowire, Bob, and Erik explore their favorite naming schemes. From there they ponder the viability of the .plumber domain, Bob's late-'70s throwback pop-soul band, getting stuck in traffic at the checkout lane, Bitcoin, an economics discussion that is wrong on so many levels we won't go into it here, all the great shows on Relay FM, idea guys, what people tune in for, Bob coming out of the closet, listening to books, Bob's new mic, Potatowire's Raspberry Pi project, and Potato Sack, the Eventual Potato Syncing System, currently in Potato-beta 5."
