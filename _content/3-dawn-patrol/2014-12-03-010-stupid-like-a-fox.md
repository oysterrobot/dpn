summary: "It's the day after Thanksgiving, and Bob, Potatowire and Erik get together to chat about some of their newest devices. Erik laments that his WeMo stack is stuck at Bob's house, Potatowire ponders building a fleet of solar-powered Arduino-based WeMo replacements, then Bob explains why he's buying an NVIDIA Shield instead of the Nexus 9, discusses what it's like to use a keyboard and mouse with his 13-inch Wacom Cintiq, and talks about his new Note 4 doesn't disappoint him. Potatowire moves on to explain why he finally ordered a Nexus 6, before the guys discuss the pros and cons of the Toshiba Chromebook 2 vs. the Acer C720, chroagh vs. crouton, i3 vs. other window managers. Finally, Erik talks about trying out Nozbe, Mailbox, Cloud Magic, Acompli, and concurrent inbox management solutions."
