summary: "Potatowire brings Erik along for a surprisingly coherent analysis of his personal tech setup. They discuss laptops, file servers and mobile devices. Along the way they touch on file syncing services, tech boredom driving purchases, Erik's work toolchain, Creative Cloud, Chromebooks, MailSteward, Linux, Solaris, FreeNAS, FreeBSD, BitTorrent Sync, Raspberry Pi Remote Backup Servers, Nexus 6 vs. Nexus 5 with a broken screen, Alarm Clock Pro, AMOLED vs. LED, unrealistic expectations, and whether you should pay attention to product reviews."
