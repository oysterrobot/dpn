Along the way, they try to figure out if Elon Musk knows how many submarine cars he may (or may not) own, and discuss getting buzzed by a quadcopter in a kayak, podstalkers, TV dramas and their understanding of the inner workings of the Air Traffic Control system, Gabe's wife stealing his iPhone 6 Plus, where to draw the line between a tablet and a phone, accidentally deleting your iTunes library, and most importantly whether Potatowire is a hipster.
