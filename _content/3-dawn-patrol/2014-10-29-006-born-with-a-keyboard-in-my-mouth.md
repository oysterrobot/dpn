summary: "With Gabe and Potatowire out, Bob and Erik trudge on by themselves. They talk about decaffeinating, fitness trackers, RSI, ergonomic mice and keyboards, learning to type, alternate input methods, VR, helmet mounted sights, modular smartphones, smartwatch battery life, devices that improve over time, discarding (not-so-old) devices, and what Erik's doing with his first-gen iPhone."
