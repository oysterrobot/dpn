summary: "Gabe, Erik, and Potatowire discuss file storage and time travel literature. Along the way, they touch on Erik's broken DAS, Crashplan restore speeds, Gabe's new Synology, WD Blacks vs. Reds, SMART Failures, two-factor authentication, building your own NAS from first principles, thumb drives, digital hoarding, bullet-time, hyperlapse, and the utopian optimism of Paul Verhoven's RoboCop."
