summary: "After a lot of thought, we've decided to take a break from producing Technical Difficulties and Dawn Patrol. We all love podcasting, and if you're reading this, you're probably one of our long-suffering listeners who has stayed with us through the short and long gaps between our shows. You're awesome."

First we want to say thank you for listening, and thank you again for all your support. We love hearing from our listeners, and your feedback has been unquestionably positive and encouraging. We'd also like to thank all our superb guests over the years. We couldn't have created a compelling show without your time, energy, and trust.

It takes a lot of effort to produce a show like Technical Difficulties. We'd hoped that Dawn Patrol would give us a low-effort  counterpart, but it didn't turn out that way. In the end, we realized that right now we aren't really interested in doing an "easy" version of Technical Difficulties, but we also realized that none of us could commit the time to do the "hard" version right.

You'll still be able to listen to Gabe chat with Jeff Hunsberger on their [Nerds on Draft](http://www.nerdsondraft.com/welcome/) podcast, or read his writing on [Macdrifter](http://macdrifter.com). Erik will continue to blog at [The Mindful Bit](http://themindfulbit.com). Bob blogs at [Takitapart](http://takitapart.com/), and Potatowire at [Potatowire's Wild Kingdom](http://potatowire.tumblr.com/). We'll all still be around on Twitter.

Thanks for listening, and talk to you again soon.
