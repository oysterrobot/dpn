### Potatoes and Power

{{ theme:partial src="zpq-timestamp" text="The Neglected History, Part 1: Peace, Glory and Darkness" }}

As nearly every schoolchild of a certain age knows, it's easy to make a simple and low-powered battery by plugging a couple of electrodes and a little bit of wire into a potato. 

What they don't know is that this type of battery has a long history that predates much of western civilization. A history where the rise and fall of  empires has rested on the power of the lowly potato.

> The edit wars that resulted from this travesty were merciless, bloody but ultimately unsuccessful, and potatoes have now been relegated to a brief mention in the "Variations" section. This sort of anti-potato bias is far too common in crowdsourced media these days.

#### The Early Years (Pre-Chicxulub)

There was a time when potatoes lived in peace with the dominant race on the planet, and the great potato empire flourished in perfect harmony. That time was known to geologists as the [Cretaceous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous) period, roughly 145 - 65 million years ago.

In the age of the dinosaurs potatoes had no need for power because they lived under the protection of the major dinosaur species. Due to high oxygen levels, potatoes grew much larger during this era than they do today. This kept them safe and strong.

Often nurtured and loved in nests like their own children, dinosaurs showed a level of care for potato-kind that has not been equaled since.

But everything changes. Strife came to dinosaur and potato-kind. Potatoes wanted a greater stake in dinosaur government. The new potatoes were younger, stronger. In their blood-thirsty craving for power, they thought they could rule the world as well as the noble dinosaurs. They were wrong.

Disagreements turned to skirmishes, skirmishes turned to all-out war. Then, the unthinkable happened.

#### The Dark Ages Begin

Nobody knows who fired the first shot, but we know who fired the last one. Somewhere just off the Yucatan peninsula, a 10km potato warhead impacted the earth's surface, releasing energy equal to 240 gigatons of TNT. Almost nothing survived.

Potatokind had won the war, but at what cost? My people's thirst for potato power by any means necessary had brought the greatest race this world has ever seen to its knees. It also left the planet [in ruins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event).

{{ theme:partial src="fancy-quote" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-T_Boundary" time="" person="zpq" quote="We finally really did it. YOU MANIACS! YOU BLEW IT UP! OH, DAMN YOU! GODDAMN YOU ALL TO HELL" }}

Records are spotty from the days, weeks, months, years, and millennia following the great Chicxulub Potato Strike. It was the beginning of the [Potatogene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleogene) era, but none of my kind knew what to do with this new age. Most went underground to shelter from the long, hard nuclear winter. Many have never returned to the light.

### Potato Battery

{{ theme:partial src="zpq-timestamp" text="A Little Power, a lot of joy" }}

The slog from apocalyptic darkness to potato modernity is a gripping story but, alas, it's one we will have to complete another day. 

You wanted to know how to make a potato battery, remember?

Well, it's simple. You can find the full details at this [helpful page here](http://cosmology.berkeley.edu/Education/DEMOS/Potato_Power/Potato_Teacher.html), but you'll need a few items:

* Potatoes
* Two coppper strips
* Two zinc strips
* Wire clips
* A multimeter

Put two different metal strips into the potato, attach the wire clips to the metal strips and multimeter, and you've got a simple potato battery. Wire together more than one potato in parallel or series and you can increase the voltage or amperage. Do this several times, and you've got enough power to light a small LED.

Don't get drunk on it and destroy the world, OK?
