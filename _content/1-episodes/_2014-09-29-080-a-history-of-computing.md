summary: >
  Dr. Drang returns to explore his
  background in computing from the late
  1970s to today. Along the way we
  discover what happens when you mess up a
  punchcard, what Linux was like in the
  early days, why he uses a Mac today, and
  his perspectives on the near future of
  computing.

*** aside on how punched card worked ***

Wikipedia has a [thorough write up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card) of the IBM style punched cards.

### types of programming
- loops and bobby on motorcycle blowing up
- not excited by computers for the sake of computers. Learned in isolation.
- Took Pascal course as technical elective which was how he learned programming 
27+39
- procedures vs functions
- s (???)
- linked lists, doubly-linked lists
- wrote text editor

["Dogfooding"](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115349/dogfooding-tech-slang-working-out-glitches) is an expression that has risen to popular culture out of nerd culture at Microsoft and generally means using your own creation for real work and not just as a QA target. The expression represents something that is fairly commonplace now in software development. Dogfooding can often reveal bugs and awkward interactions models that scripted testing may not.

- LINK dogfooding
- wrote text editor as capstone
- LINK "why pascal is not my favorite language"
- first program as a tool as graduate school--reliability calculation
- explaining to a computer in a program, changed the way he taught it.
- LINK blogging technical solutions

> My first computer was a calculator. It was a [Texas Instruments TI-74](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-74) pocket computer. It was hard to call it a computer even then. But it was programmable using BASIC and it was the first time I could write down logic and have it repeatedly executed with different input. It was a computer.
> 
> Programming that little piece of plastic was not fun. It displayed one line at a time and forget any reasonable stack trace. But it made me think and plan my programs carefully because for that exact reason. Dumb mistakes were even less fun than now.


### Home computing
- commodore 64 
- 1985 fat mac looked like space man--fostered love of computers
- LINK Bloom County
- multitasking - programs inserted "break points"
- kernel extensions
- unstable
- Apple wanted to buy a company (NeXT in the end) made him think that 
- LINK os 10.0 date
- Unix philosophy (otw, pipes, etc.)
- 1996 Linux
- Redhat Linux
ASIDE my first Linux, "Dummies" book, made binders, etc.
- packages and package managers
43:00
- messing with it all the time
- multimedia (movies and music)
- working to get work done saved time in the long run -- skills
- 10.4or5 late 2004-5
- report wf from anit
- terminal vs. GUI - always a mix, always terminal window ready
- vi/Vim, emacs, netedit
- BBEdit on mac
- omnigraffle acorn for visual 
- dumbing-down direction of osx is troubling
- Scripting is still there: Python, Perl, AppleScript (ot as good as it should be)
- Sandboxing (breakage expectected, Apple doesn't care about the legacy - Win goes too far)
- OS X without the Unix would drive Dr. Drang away)
- 2.7 vs 3.4(5?) -- poor 3 adoption
- Apple not using GNU versions, loses some future. Worse than the Lagging [looking into Darwin]
- inter-app communication, workarounds, eg BBEdit CLI tools not available in MAS version
- trend away from reluctantly-used term power user is hopefully slow enough that he will be retired before the bottom
- iPad good in many ways, but even apps like Pythonista can't come close to computer with all the tools.
- iOS silos. Viticci makes work happeInitially, had to have a Lisa to develop, Mac Pascal was interpreter but, not compiler
- OS X as the truck. That's fine, but why dd doesn't care to have an iPad
- ihnatko on big phones (anit on big phones?
- timestamp of iPhones indicates our slowness (9 AUG)
- jeans and cargo pockets, schlumpy, perfect market for dd
- larger iPhone obviating the need for iPad more generally
- Goble on app size continuum and Terp's disagreement, dd expects resonlution ind ependence. %, distance, not pixels, dd figures that's the purpose of retina
1:08
- Apple patent for docking device [similar linuxy things], Handoff leading to prefs etc carried over, no divisions btn devices
- fear being one thing lost = everything lost
- offload the things you care about
- Jobs NeXT interview --> having his computer environment anywhere...why is iCloud sucking, given this idea of Jobs's
- ubiquity != iCloud
- Yojimbo [find iCloud syncing post] --> shift to Evernote
- Apple-native feeling...die Evernote get there?
## leaving Mac. miss most
- BBEdit
- Applescript (tech, not lang) --> power outside the cli
- [Autohotkey] --> API mindset [Spolsky post]
- MAS apps losing AppleScript libraries
- [Swift as follow-on to Applescript] [is Swift a trainwreck?]
- no Preview Applescript --> Apple isn't even supporting AS, why should devs?
- js bridges
- can't even select 
- devs control the hooks/terminology, so you get divergent. Apple doesn't set a good example
- eg getting selected text
- OS X as single package would be lost in move to Linux
- can't really understand Windows...

# DD input
Sorry I'm late with this, but work has gotten in the way and I just couldn't bear to listen to myself for so long.

I did want to give you something about the Think/Lightspeed compilers. There's a nice interview with Rich Siegel here

http://www.imore.com/debug-36-rich-siegel-bbedit

in which he talks about his days with Think. I had hoped to find a scan of one of the old Lightspeed ads but came up empty. I did, however, find Potatowire's nascent show notes, so I have better idea now of where he needs help.

I happen to have an old punchcard in my office (I found it several years ago being used as a bookmark), so I scanned it and put it here

https://www.dropbox.com/s/3nls5ifzsy8x1pw/punchcard.jpg?dl=0

It's not the buff color that most cards were, but it is pristine.

I'll try to get you more links tonight.

Regards,
Mark
