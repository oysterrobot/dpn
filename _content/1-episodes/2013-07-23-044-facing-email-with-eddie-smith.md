summary: 'Gabe and Erik are joined by Eddie Smith of Practically Efficient to talk about email. With dozens of competing messaging services, why do we still use email? How should we organize it? In the era of social networking, what are people's cultural expectations around how email is used? What barriers does email present to good communication, and how do we overcome those barriers to make email useful? This week's session of Generational Offtopic looks Eddie's work with TEDx.'
