### Headphones
{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="0:00" }}

A good pair of headphones is indispensable for recording, editing and enjoying audio. Here is a short list of the headphones we use, and why.

> I was lucky enough to have a knowledgeable friend talk my wife into buying me these headphones for Christmas, and they've been great. I use them for recording and editing, and their collapsability makes them seem much smaller than they actually are when not in use.

### The Microphones We Use to Record
{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="4:36" }}

The first thing you need if you're going to start recording a podcast is a good microphone. Unless you want to set up a mixing board and really geek out on the audio, there seem to be two primary contenders in this space, the RØDE Podcaster and the Blue Yeti.

#### Gabe's Recording Microphone

#### Erik's Recording Microphone
{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="5:00" }}

> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="erik" text="Blue Yeti" }}
>
> The Yeti is a great USB mic with some pretty neat extra features. In addition to the headphone plug with master volume, it also has a mute button, dedicated gain control, and a nifty selector that changes the microphone's [polar pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardioid_microphone#Microphone_polar_patterns) between, stereo, cardioid, omni, and bidirectional layouts. The Yeti is a side-address microphone, which means you talk into its side, not the end.
>
> {{ theme:partial src="image" title="Yeti Pattern Settings" show="{{ number }}" file="yeti-settings.jpg" }}
>
> ##### Pros
> 
> * Headphone plug and dedicated volume control
> * Polar pattern selector offers a lot of options for position and sensitivity. Blue has [some suggestions](http://bluemic.com/yeti/#/settings/) for how to use this feature on their website.
> * Dedicated gain control 
> * Excellent sound quality
>
> ##### Cons
>
> * Side-address and weight means it can be tough to keep upright on a boom
> * Minimal shock isolation out of the box &ndash; you'll want a boom and shock mount at the very least

{{ theme:partial src="product" show="{{ number }}" image="blue-yeti.jpg" name="Blue Microphones Yeti" description="The Yeti is one of the most advanced and versatile multi-pattern USB microphones available anywhere. Combining three capsules and four different pattern settings, the Yeti is an ultimate tool for creating amazing recordings, directly to your computer." msrp="$149.99" manufacturer="http://bluemic.com/yeti/" amazon="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VA464S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002VA464S&linkCode=as2&tag=theminbit-20" }}

### Microphone Accessories
{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="5:47" }}

While the microphones mentioned above both have simple mounting solutions out of the box, you'll probably want to add a boom and shock mount, and maybe even a [pop filter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_filter). 

The first two help you reposition the mic and isolate it from vibrations (like typing and bumping your chair into your desk). The Podcaster and Yeti are surprisingly large, and it can be really helpful to get them off your desk. A pop filter helps keep the recording from clipping on words like... well... "popping".

### Other Microphones
{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="8:00" }}

Sometimes a big boom-mounted studio microphone isn't what you're looking for. Mobile and lecture-hall recording requires something a little more portable and discreet. These smaller microphones may work well where the others don't.

We've taken several different microphones and swapped them out during our recording session, so you can hear how they sound. In general, we've tried to leave the levels and other sound settings the same so you can hear the differences between each microphone as accurately as possible.

> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="erik" text="Shush" }}

> Gabe and I both use a great little Mac app called "Shush" for temporarily muting our microphones while recording the show. Shush lets you specify a hotkey (mine is the "fn" key) that can be used in push-to-talk or push-to-silence modes.
>
> Push-to-talk is really helpful for long conference calls where you know you'll be doing more listening than talking anyway, especially if you've got a noisy background. Push-to-silence is great if you need to cough during a recording, and it's both easier to use and more responsive than the hardware mute button on my Yeti.

### Casual Microphones
{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="16:06" }}

Here are a few desktop-use microphones that we had lying around for comparison. One (the Logitech G35) is a gaming headset, and the others are built-in headsets on a MacBook Pro and Apple 27&prime; Thunderbolt Display. 

Unsurprisingly none of these options are optimal for high-quality recording.

#### Logitech G35
{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="16:20" }}

> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="erik" text="A Mutable Gaming Headset" }}
>
> The G35 a USB headset targeted at online gamers which offers a few buttons on the left ear cup and a swing-down mic boom. 
>
> On a PC the buttons are programmable, but on Macs they're locked to next-track, play/pause, and previous-track. There's a hard mute button, but the headset will also mute when you swing the boom mic up, which can be really helpful on a long phone conference.
>
> The headphones sound great, but (as you'll hear in the recording) the microphone is unremarkable. As it runs without supporting software on the Mac, the general consensus is that it sounds better on PCs. At this time I haven't been able confirm that myself.
>
> ##### Pros
> 
> * Convenient all-in-one package
> * Boom mic raises for mute
> * Sound quality
>
> ##### Cons
>
> * Weak Mac support
> * Average microphone quality
> * No discernable [sidetone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidetone).
