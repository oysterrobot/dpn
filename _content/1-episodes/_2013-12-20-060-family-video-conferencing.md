### Services


#### Facetime

* Easiest
* iOS/Mac Only
* Audio/Video

FaceTime is one of those services that just works. However, it requires everyone to be on an Apple device. [Once upon a time](http://readwrite.com/2010/06/07/apples_biggest_news_video_calling_as_open_standard) Apple promised an open standard for FaceTime, but 3 years later, I don't expect it to happen.

While the rate of successful connections [seems to be dropping](http://www.imore.com/why-facetime-quality-might-have-dropped-why-apple-still-hasnt-released-it-open-standard-and-patent) the quality while connected is stunning. With the blessing of the mobile carriers, many users can even use FaceTime over a cellular network, making it a solid virtual-presence service.

Other than requiring an Apple device, the main downside to FaceTime is the lack of group video conferencing. This is real dissapointment when attempting to use the service for family conferencing. It's not so much a conference as a huddle.

[Alternatives to FaceTime](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/56356/what-alternatives-exist-to-facetime-or-imessages-to-communicate-with-android-dev)

#### Skype

* Cross platform
* Stagnated a bit
* Fairly user friendly

Unlike FaceTime, the Skype service allows you to call mobile and landline phones but it will [cost you](http://www.skype.com/en/rates/) a modest fee.

[Skype Installers](http://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-computer/)

There's a lot to like about the options with Skype with video, audio and text chat as well as [file sharing](http://www.skype.com/en/features/send-files/) and [screen sharing](https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10022/how-do-i-share-my-screen-in-skype-for-mac-os-x). What there isn't is a high quality of transmission. Skype is notorious among podcasters as being the source of a large amount of anguish.

#### Hangouts

* Google+ Based
* Cross Platform
* Can be difficult to set up

### Hardware
