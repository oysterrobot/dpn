### Do you scan much?

Erik and Gabe talk about their general scanning workflows, Erik tries to remember what the stuff the postal service delivers is called, and Gabe reveals a deep-seated hatred for paper on his desk. We judge. 
> #### Producer's Note
>  The [first rule of Gabe's desk](www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/) is that nothing goes on Gabe's desk.

* Once it is set up, the [Fujitsu ScanSnap iX500](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ATZ9QMO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00ATZ9QMO&linkCode=as2&tag=potatowire-20) can connect to your computer via WiFi, allowing your "scanning Pedestal" to be free of wires.

* The only time the computer is needed is to change the scanner's configuration, which means your desk can be a paper-free-zone

* Erik's "legacy" [ScanSnap S1500M](http://www.fujitsu.com/us/services/computing/peripherals/scanners/scansnap/scansnap-s1500m.html) retains most of the same capability as newer models, but is a strictly USB device.

### Scanning Workflow at the Desk

* The linchpin of Gabe's system is to process incoming paper according to [GTD](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofNR_WkoCE&t=40) principles. 

* Anything that is not sensitive in nature can be scanned, and by Gabe's default, will go right into [Evernote](https://www.evernote.com/referral/Registration.action?uid=117091&sig=c008e6b26a1839c60958169092eb6b42)

* For anything better encrypted, the configuration can be changed on the Mac and all scans can be secured manually.

> #### Producer's Note
>  There are many ways to encrypt the scanned data at this point. Each PDF can be separately encoded right in OS X or in an app like [PDFpen](http://smilesoftware.com/PDFpen/index.html)

> You can also keep all sensitive information in a [disk image](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_image/) that be encrypted by [OS X](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1578) or using an app such as [Knox](https://agilebits.com/knox/)

* If you're utilizing an encrypted disk image, [DEVONthink](http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/) can process the scans into this image once unlocked, as Gabe describes.

> #### Producer's Note
>   Erik and Gabe spent some time with Jim Neumann of DEVONtechnologies on Generational 042, and it's a great way to learn more about DEVONthink.

* There is plenty of fire safe variety, but [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004QWZINW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B004QWZINW&linkCode=as2&tag=potatowire-20) SentrySafe has been a great choice for many years.

> #### Producer's Note
>  The question of what to keep in hard copy has always bothered me, so I keep more than I should. In general, taxes probably represent the area I have been most paranoid about meticulous record keeping, but that doesn't meant that you need to keep shoe boxes full of receipts around for years to come. The IRS has [some guidance](http://www.irs.gov/publications/p17/ch01.html#en_US_2012_publink1000170670) on what to keep, but, "The IRS does not require you to keep your records in a particular way. Keep them in a manner that allows you and the IRS to determine your correct tax." This seems surprisingly reasonable to me....

### Scanning Workflow on the Go

There are many good apps for canning on the go, and depending on your needs, an iOS device can be your only scanner. 

* [Scanner Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-by-readdle/id333710667) - Faxing for $.99 a unit

* [Genius Scan](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/genius-scan-pdf-scanner/id377672876) - The same developer's [Genius Fax](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/genius-fax-fax-pdf-documents/id566504821) can unsurprisingly be used to fax. It offers better package pricing than Scanner Pro.

> #### Producer's Note
>  Erik's comment about the "steam cleaner" scanner form factor brought [this Hack](http://www.mpetroff.net/archives/2013/09/25/scanner-modifications-to-scan-large-documents/) to mind. Overlap and [image stitching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_stitching) managed by python? Pretty cool.


[OCR](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition/) on iOS has come a long way since Gabe's "not great" [OCRKit](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id388421968), and new apps offer a very reliable way to create searchable documents.

* [ABBY FineScanner](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id534203582?utm_source=HQ&utm_medium=infobanner&utm_campaign=FineScanner%20iOS), 

* Gabe's Canon PIXMA MX880 has been replaced by the [MX922](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AVWKUJS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00AVWKUJS&linkCode=as2&tag=potatowire-20)

* [receiptmate](https://itunes.apple.com/app/receiptmate-scan-your-receipts/id668694949) scans right to Evernote and it it can even provide spending reports.

> #### Producer's Note
> If you have even the sligtest desire to learn more about this topic, I hightly recomment David Sparks's [Paperless](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/paperless/id520393162) iBook. It is excellent.
