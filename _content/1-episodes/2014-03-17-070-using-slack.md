[CriticMarkup](http://criticmarkup.com) is a project that [seeks to](http://www.macdrifter.com/2013/02/everyones-a-critic-the-critic-markup-language-proposal.html) bring the editorial benefits of tracked changes to the wonderful word of plain text. It was the first big thing that Erik and Gabe worked on together, and the quickly realized how hard it was to do. Already being prone to trying out *every* possible solution to *every* possible workflow, they when on a chat [vision quest](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090270/)

* [Glassboard](http://glassboard.com/)
* [Google Hangouts](http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/)
* [Viber](http://www.viber.com/)
* [Patter](http://patter-app.net/)
* [Basecamp](http://basecamp.com/)
* [Wordpress P2](http://p2theme.com/)

There are many players in the team collaboration space, but each of them lack at least some critical feature. Erik and Gabe's needs were not necessarily universal, but they were not unique either.

* [Slack](https://slack.com/) is a messaging tool designed by Flickr co-founder [Stewart Butterfield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Butterfield), and it is the logical outworking of the [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irc)-esque system that he and his team designed and used while building the browser based [MMO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game) game called [Glitch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_(video_game)), which has [since shut down](http://www.glitchthegame.com/closing/). Unlike Glitch, Slack has already garnered a large user base.

#### Chat in Channels

> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="gabe" text="Chat Messaging" }}
> 
> Each channel is it's own chat board. Messages are associated with only one channel but files can be associated with multiple channels. Chat is not threaded in Slack but you can link to a specific comment if needed. The linking process is a bit tedious but works well enough.4
Marking messages as a favorite (starring) also makes them more easily accessible in the sidebar. This was helpful for referring back to specific statements or files.
> 
> Chat posts feel instant in Slack. Posting from iOS causes the message to refresh dynamically on the web page in under a second. I initially thought that we were benefiting from the beta status and low user count. However, as Slack moved out of beta and received a lot of press, I have not noticed in difference in posting. It's fast.
>
> The notifications in Slack work great. The work on iOS, Mac and with a web browser that supports notifications. They are also almost instant. As soon as a message appears on the web page, I receive a notification on iOS. If a Slack instance is open and active, there are no notifications. Imagine that.
>
> zImg for iOS and app notifications
>
> Slack also provides a separate option to turn on additional notification options like email, or turn notifications off completely.
While direct messages receive a slight highlight color, I could imagine an active channel with many contributors could be a bit confusing. The only differentiation between users is the avatar. I'd like a way to add some subtle call-out coloring to a particular user. But that's a minor complaint when I consider that Slack already provides an option to selectively highlight user selected keywords.
>
> I also really like the option to delete or edit a message in Slack. One of the most frustration aspects of Glassboard is the inability to fix a typo on a group board. Slack solved this from the start. The option to delete a file attachment or even an entire channel is great too. No need to clutter a board unnecessarily with mistakes.
Files and images, as well as Emoji, are displayed in-line and with obvious indication of the file types. Clicking an in-line object opens the instance in Slack for viewing or opens the external file for editing where appropriate.

#### Links

#### File Handling

> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="gabe" text="File Handling" }}
> 
> The Slack Mac and web apps both support dragging any file into the window to upload it to Slack. The item is tagged to the current channel for easy browsing but you also get a complete list of all files available to the group.
>
> Files like PDFs, text files and Word documents are indexed for searching. They're not just embedded chat links, they are working documents.
Paste in a Google Doc link and that also becomes searchable within Slack and directly linked from the group chat and search results. The Slack file organization and browsing is also well considered. Browse just your private documents, a single channel or all documents across all groups. You can also filter attachments by file type and favorite status.
>
> zImg iOS-file-filters, app-file-filters

While you can easily reference a file in a chat, each file also has it's own comment thread. This is nice when working on a document together, even a Google Doc. It makes it convenient to discuss changes and make them at the same time. Or use the comments as a reference for reviewing changes.
Files in Slack have a title and comment field to provide additional context and meta data. You can paste directly into the message box to upload an image or drag a file to the browser (or app) window.

#### Pricing Tiers

> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="gabe" text="Business Model" }}
> 
> I'm happy to see that Slack has a real business model from the start. A free account is available but limits include, a maximum of 10,000 messages stored in the archive, a maximum of 5GB of file storage and a maximum of 5 integrations. That's pretty generous.
> 
> The standard account are $8 per user per month. That seems reasonable for something that I've used every day since joining the beta. This removes most of the limits but raises the maximum file storage to 10GB. It will eventually grant guest access and email forwarding to Slack as well.
> 
> The "Plus" account is not yet available but will will add 20GB of storage and a future feature of external channels for $15 per user per month.

> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="gabe" text="Search" }}
> 
> The search function in Slack is a huge win. Not only is it exhaustive but it's fast too. Finding files is easy with the file browser but finding a specific conversation thread is just as easy.
>
> zImg iOS-search, app-search
>
> The results aren't just the exact sentence or word that matches, but rather a few messages above and below the match. I think this is pretty important for search in a message-centric application than can have thousands of messages. After a couple years of use, search results could become useless otherwise.
As I mentioned in the file handling section, the content of attached files are also searchable. While the file hits are obvious in the search results, there's no way to know exactly where in the file, the term was found.

#### Working with Code Syntax Snippets

> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="gabe" text="Messaging and code" }}
> 
> Slack knows its audience well. At any time I can send formatted code as a message. Just start typing in the chat box and hit ⌘ + ⏎ to bring up a code entry screen. There's a good variety of syntax highlighters available too.
>
> zImg slack-code
> 
>The thing I really like about this implementation is that a bit of code can be given a title as well as its own comment thread. This helps with search and context. So great.

#### Slack Support

* Gabe

> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="potatowire" text="It's not that bad" }}
> 
> Gabe exaggerates, I'm only stuck on IE 7. That being said, I was able to rig up some ugly JavaScript and HTML forms to send chat using Slack's [incoming webhook](https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook) integration. We are using Slack for everything now, too.
