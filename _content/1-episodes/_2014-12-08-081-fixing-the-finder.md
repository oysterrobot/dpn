File management &ndash; especially with the OS X Finder &ndash; is a pain. Everyone knows it, and nearly everyone has tried to do something about it. This week Gabe and Erik talk through a few apps that have made the chore a little less tedious.

Even though it's seen some improvement over the years (namely tabs and simple file renaming) the Finder always seems to be part of the problem rather than part of the solution. Gabe has taken matters into his own hands and uses a popular replacement, [Path Finder 7](http://www.cocoatech.com/pathfinder/) by Cocoatech.

* Tabs
* Information Panels

{{ theme:partial src="app" show="{{ number }}" image="pathfinder.png" name="Path Finder 7" description="Path Finder offers the tools you need to access, browse, and manage all of your files quickly on OS X. Packed with a plethora of powerful features, Path Finder allows you to take complete control of your documents, photos, videos, music, and so much more." price="$39.95" developer="http://www.cocoatech.com/pathfinder/" appstore="" }}

{{ theme:partial src="fancy-quote" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="2:10" person="gabe" quote="It's almost like a HUD for files" }}

Erik has used Path Finder in the past, but it always seemed hard to remember to use it instead of Finder

* Gabe uses it for heavy lifting
* He doesn't force quit the Finder while using it since it seems to make things less stable.
* It's an extra tool on top of the finder
* It's been most useful for massive file movement, where it has proven to be much more reliable than Finder.
* It's still under active development

#### The Drop Stack

* Gives one spot to put multiple files from many locations for copying via drag and drop
* Also allows LIFO file copy actions

#### Split-Pane Browsing

#### Saved Browser Views

* You can have the viewport really busy or really minimal
* Once you get a layout you're happy with, you can save that view for later reuse

#### Tag Panel

* List View
* Cloud View

#### The Sidebar

* Favorites
* Recents
* Each subvolume within a network drive gets its own item in the sidebar

{{ theme:partial src="section-header" title="ExpanDrive" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="14:20" }}

* Menu Bar app
* Mounts cloud services as system volumes

{{ theme:partial src="app" show="{{ number }}" image="expandrive.png" name="ExpanDrive" description="ExpanDrive is the fastest way to upload and manage files in the Cloud. Access files in the Cloud just like a USB drive connected to your Mac or PC." price="$49.95" developer="http://www.expandrive.com/expandrive" appstore="" }}

* Supports a ton of services
* Opportunity to run instead of sync engines
* Allows files to stay off your machine, this is a plus or minus depending on whether you need those files when you're offline
* Gives you the power of desktop tools without having to go to that service's online file management page.

{{ theme:partial src="section-header" title="Default Folder X" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="21:55" }}

* Enhances the system open/save dialog
* Adds a frame around the existing dialog with tags, recent folders, and favorites

{{ theme:partial src="app" show="{{ number }}" image="default-folder-x.png" name="Default Folder X" description="Default Folder X makes Mac OS X's Open and Save dialogs work as quickly as you do. Custom keyboard shortcuts put your favorite and recent folders at your fingertips. Pop-up menus let you navigate your folders and open Finder windows." price="$34.95" developer="http://www.stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX/" appstore="" }}

* Works well in Yosemite
* Allows tags and comments while saving
* Quick select via hovering over a Finder window
