Welcome to our new podcast and our new site. We're thrilled you've joined us, and frankly we weren't sure this was ever going to actually happen.

Now that we're here, we want to tell you what this show is all about. [Generational](http://www.70decibels.com/generational/) was a fantastic experience, but we wanted to create something more focused, more useful, and hopefully even more enjoyable for our listeners. That's where Technical Difficulties comes in.

Technology is hard. Our devices are often frustratingly broken for us or our loved ones. And yet we're all compelled by necessity or passion to live in this frustrating world of tech and muddle through as best we can. While we can't always fix these broken bits of our lives, we can often make things better. 

That's where this show comes in. With short, focused looks at specific problem areas, we hope to help you help yourself and other people around you when things go wrong. 

We also want to welcome [@potatowire](http://twitter.com/potatowire) as our new producer. We've got big plans for our show notes, and he's been hard at work behind the scenes making them distinctive, detailed and useful. 

We're already grateful for Potatowire's unique perspective. As he puts it:

> The show is not about admiring the problem, but is instead about pursuing the solution.

Thanks for listening, expect the first "real" episode soon, and we can't wait to hear what you think of our solutions.
