#### What is Plex?

#### Serving your Files

* Synology (file-host)
* Mac Mini (file server)
* Multiple servers

The Synology is a terrific NAS but it's not the only server to provide an easy setup for Plex. On the Synology it takes a couple of clicks to add a Plex server. Once it's up and running, the plex server is controled through the same web interface as from any other Plex server. The Plex server on the Synology runs well enough but large MKV files had a noticeable lag when loading. I think the default RAM configuration on a Synology is too small to run all of the standard file sharing services PLUS a Plex server.

Using a Mac Mini as the Plex server provided a better experience. The files all still lived on the Synology NAS, so that rules out disk performance or network streaming as a bottleneck.

One primary benefit of the Plex server running on the Synology is that it starts at boot and all of the files are available at any time. On the Mac Mini you'll need to setup some scripts and cron jobs to check and remount the NAS if the Mini reboots. I've ordered more memory for my Synology since I really just want the Plex server running on my NAS. I don't really want a Mac Mini media server.



#### Viewing your Movies

* Roku
* iOS
* Album Art
* Metadata

{{ theme:partial src="section-header" title="Let's Talk about the Roku" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="10:27" }}

#### The Remote

* WiFi
* Kid-Friendly Buttons
* Motion Sensing
* Built-in Headphone Jack

The Roku remote is a bit cartoonish but far more functional than the AppleTV remote. It's big and plastic with purple buttons but it wins when you're feeling for a button in the dark. It would be even better with a backlighting. The other great feature of the Roku remote is the WiFi connection. It doesn't use traditional IR which means direct line of sight is not required.

The Roku 3 remote also includes a motion sensor for controling games, if that's your thing. But the best feature is the headphone port. Plug in a pair of headphones to the Roku remote and watch a movie on the home theater without waking up the kids. Every functional detail was considered (except backlighting) with the Roku remote. It's a real selling point.

If you'd prefer to use a $600 remote, there are several passable iOS apps. The real benefit with an iOS app is the keyboard support for search. Unlike the iOS app for the AppleTV, the Roku iOS apps only send text after the enter key is pressed. Gabe found this annoying. Honestly, the Roku remote is pretty darn good but the iOS app can be used for more complicated searches.

#### The Channels

* Plex
* Netflix
* Amazon Prime
* Spotify

>
> The channel selection on the Roku includes most of the channels I cared about on the AppleTV plus some that were pleasant surprises. The Disney Channels work well and actually have good content. I also like the Vimeo channel. On the Roku it's easy to organize the channel lis. With a channel highlighted, hit the "*" key on the remote to move the channel around the list. Or just delete a channel entirely. Roku provides web access to add and remove channels through a browser.
> 
> The Amazon channel is really where the Roku shines. While it's missing the iTunes store, the Amazon video content is really compelling. Amazon Prime provides a nice bonus for Prime members without spending anything (such as the entire Avatar series) but at comparable rental prices, Amazon offers about as much as iTunes.
>
> M-Go is another Roku video rental service. I find that it has more up to date content at higher prices. Whereas Amazon is about $5 for an HD rental, M-Go is generally $6.
> 
> Crackle is another channel that I've used only through the Roku. The content is of variable and sometimes dubious quality but ocassionally there will be a nice surprise like Ghostbusters available for free.

#### What we miss

* Subscriptions
* iTunes Radio
* iTunes Remote App
* Quick and easy purchasing

{{ theme:partial src="fancy-quote" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="14:38" person="gabe" quote="I ended up just unplugging the Apple TV" }}

AppleTV really owns the market on series subscriptions. With automatic downloads in iTunes and new episode notifications, Apple makes it convenient to subscribe to an entire season of a TV show and keep up.

Watching a TV series through the Roku is possible but it takes planning and research. Sure, you could use something like [Sickbeard](http://sickbeard.com) to do some less than ideal things, but that's quite a bit more work than purchasing through the AppleTV.

> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="gabe" text="I Miss Music" }}
>
> While I've loaded Plex with my music library, I really miss the iTunes Radio and Beats Music for streaming services. There's Pandora, Spotify and Rdio support through the Roku but iTunes Radio and Beats are what I prefer. Unfortunately on the Plex side of things, there's not a lot I like. There are very few good audio channels for Plex.

Purchasing through the Amazon service on Roku is pretty easy once it's configured. There's a lot of content on the Amazon store. Search and browse on the Roku is good enough to find what you're looking for. The only advantage to Apple in this area is the convenience of purchasing through the iTunes Store iOS app. If you hear of a good flick or TV show to watch when you're away from your TV, the iOS app is convient for making regretable purchases. Maybe the lack of Amazon video purchases on iOS isn't such a bad thing.

#### Within the Apple Ecosystem

* iOS App
* AirPlay

{{ theme:partial src="fancy-quote" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="20:57" person="gabe" quote="I've had my Apple TV disconnected for so long I can't remember" }}

#### Plex Pass

* Plex It
* Cloud-based media

{{ theme:partial src="fancy-quote" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="27:18" person="gabe" quote="I don't have a lot of friends" }}

The [Plex Pass](https://plex.tv/subscription/about) is a good deal for the features. There are three different price points to satisfy most users: $4 per month, $30 per year or $75 for a lifetime subscription. The Plex Pass provides camera upload, cload streaming and syncing with a mobile device. All of the premium features work well and Plex is a totally different experience on iOS with it.

#### The Apps

#### Other Neat Stuff Plex can Do
