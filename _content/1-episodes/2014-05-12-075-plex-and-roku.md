>
> There are a lot of channels available through the Roku. The Disney Channels work well and actually have good content. I also like the Vimeo channel. On the Roku it's easy to organize the channel lis. With a channel highlighted, hit the "*" key on the remote to move the channel around the list.
> 
> The Amazon channel is really where the Roku shines. While it's missing the iTunes store, the Amazon video content is really compelling. Amazon Prime provides a nice bonus for Prime members without spending anything (such as the entire Avatar series) but at comparable rental prices, Amazon offers about as much as iTunes.
>
> M-Go is another Roku video rental service. I find that it has more up to date content at higher prices. Whereas Amazon is about $5 for an HD rental, M-Go is generally $6.
> 
> Crackle is another channel that I've used only through the Roku. The content is of variable and sometimes dubious quality but ocassionally there will be a nice surprise like Ghostbusters available for free.

#### What we miss

* iTunes Remote App
* Quick and easy purchasing

{{ theme:partial src="fancy-quote" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="14:38" person="gabe" quote="I ended up just unplugging the Apple TV" }}

> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="gabe" text="I Miss Music" }}
>
> While I've loaded Plex with my music library, I really miss the iTunes Radio and Beats Music for streaming services. There's Pandora, Spotify and Rdio support through the Roku but iTunes Radio and Beats are what I prefer. Unfortunately on the Plex side of things, there's not a lot I like. There are very few good audio channels for Plex.

{{ theme:partial src="section-header" title="Using Plex" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="19:10" }}

#### Within the Apple Ecosystem

* iOS App
* AirPlay

{{ theme:partial src="fancy-quote" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="20:57" person="gabe" quote="I've had my Apple TV disconnected for so long I can't remember" }}

#### Plex Pass

* Plex It
* Cloud-based media

{{ theme:partial src="fancy-quote" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="27:18" person="gabe" quote="I don't have a lot of friends" }}

The [Plex Pass](https://plex.tv/subscription/about) is a good deal for the features. There are three different price points to satisfy most users: $4 per month, $30 per year or $75 for a lifetime subscription. The Plex Pass provides camera upload, cload streaming and syncing with a mobile device. All of the premium features work well and Plex is a totally different experience on iOS with it.

#### The Apps

{{ theme:partial src="app" show="{{ number }}" image="plex-app.png" name="Plex" description="With Plex, you can easily stream your videos, music, photos and home movies to your iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch from your home computer running Plex Media Server (available for free at http://plex.tv).
