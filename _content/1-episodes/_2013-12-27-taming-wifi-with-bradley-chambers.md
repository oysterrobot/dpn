We didn't cover channel width because it doesn't affect home users as much, but it does affect speeds. Learn more [here](http://www.connect802.com/80211n_channels.htm).  Channel width and QAM is very important in 802.11ac to see max speeds. Learning more [here](http://blogs.aerohive.com/blog/the-wi-fi-security-blog/real-world-80211ac-speeds-qam-and-channel-width)
