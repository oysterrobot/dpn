> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="gabe" text="Sublime Text" }}
>
> I've progressed through TextEdit, TextMate and BBEdit to end at Sublime Text as my primary text editor. The best part about Sublime Text is the keyboard-centric control it provides. Everything is a keybinding or accessible through fuzzy text matching in the command palette.
> 
> The second best thing about Sublime Text is the ludicrous number of plugins available. The SDK for Sublime Text provides enough control over the application that plugins feel like a natural part of the main program and not an add-on script. I think the great diversity in the plugins results from the multi-platform support in Sublime Text. A Sublime Text license works on Mac, Windows or Unix and many of the plugins work equally well on all three platforms.
>
> My least part of Sublime Text are the configuration files. To adjust or tweak anything requires a deep dive on a JSON file. For those looking for just a basic writing app, this is probably a deal-breaker, but for anyone that has worked in HTML, CSS or any programming language, then it's trivial. The text-based configuration files are very flexible and which means there's more control over every little detail in Sublime Text. That's a net gain in my book.
>
> I prefer medium-light text on a dark background. Many people call this "dark mode". I call it "not squinting mode." There are also ["inverted" modes](http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/26331/why-are-inverted-colors-considered-an-accessibility-feature) that some prefer. Whatever text editor you use, I recommend finding a theme that works everywhere and sticking with it, especially if there is any kind of syntax coloring. It takes the distraction out of the distraction-free writing environment.
>
> Take a look at [Colorsublime](http://colorsublime.com/) for a great collection of themes as well as an interactive demo of each. This is a seriously awesome resource.
>
> [Buy Me a Soda](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/) is a very popular theme for Sublime Text and TextMate but there are plenty of [great themes](http://kkga.github.io/spacegray/) around. Pick one and then stick with it for at least 6 months. Stop futzing with your color schemes.
> 
> There are [a few plugins I recommend](http://www.macdrifter.com/2014/01/a-sublime-writing-experience.html) for Sublime Text that make for a better writing experience. None of them are necessary. But at the very least, get comfortable with the [commands and memorize the keyboard shortcuts built](http://www.macdrifter.com/2012/08/sublime-text-shortcuts-for-writing.html) into Sublime Text. Being able to quickly jump through a document makes all the difference when working on a large block of text. I also recommend [learning how to use split panes](http://www.macdrifter.com/2012/07/sublime-text-working-with-multiple-panes.html).

#### Gabe's Mobile Workflow
{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="8:25" }}

* Editorial
* Dropbox
* Nebulous Notes
* WriteRoom
* Generational 048
* Day One
* Gabe's journaling article

> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="gabe" text="Editorial" }}
>
> Editorial is the pinnacle of writing on iOS and may be one of my favorite writing tools. The singular focus of an iPad helps to enforce my intent but there's just enough flexibility in Editorial to let me quickly look something up on the web without falling down a rat hole.
>
> For the uninitiated, Editorial is a Dropbox-enabled plain text editor for the iPad. At launch, it provides a light and dark writing mode, document syncing, Dropbox powered version control, MultiMarkdown preview and a built-in web browser. But the real power of Editorial is the workflow engine that extends the application in a variety of ways. There are plenty of overviews of the application, as well as a book you can buy to learn more about the tool. But I'd recommend a few workflows to get you started:
>
Paste Workflow to save effort trying to trigger the pop-over
Select Forward and Backward by whole words
Find and Replace workflow
Smart Case conversion workflow
