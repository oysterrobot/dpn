### A High-Volume Writer
{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="0:00" }}

Some blogger consume an above-average amount of space.

{{ theme:partial src="image" show="{{ number }}" title="Big boned" file="high-volume.jpg" }}

The good news is that these same bloggers are also in the habit of spending an unusal amount of time considering an above-average amount of time refining their writing workflow. We can all benefit from listening in on this sort of navel-gazing.

#### Gabe's Desktop workflow

* [Mind map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map)
* [iThoughts](http://www.macdrifter.com/2013/12/ithoughts-is-the-premier-mind-mapping-software-for-mac-and-ios-sponsor.html)
* [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
* [nvAlt](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/)
* [TextDrop](https://www.textdropapp.com/home/Home)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Sublime Text SFTP Plugin](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/sftp)

{{ theme:partial src="fancy-quote" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="8:07" person="gabe" quote="I made her use Pages before they ruined Pages" }}

Gabe [has mentioned mind maps before](http://technicaldifficulties.us/assets/img/mapsdrifter.jpg), but as he points out, he is quick with iThoughts and it is just the way he thinks about a big project. From here it is palin text all the way down. From a basic tool like nvALT to the more complex ones such as Sublime Text, it is easy to manage your writing when it all lives in soem form of plain text. Through the wonders of TextDrop, you can even have ubiquitous access to your notesin 
[almost any web browser](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie).

> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="gabe" text="Sublime Text" }}
>
> I've progressed through TextEdit, TextMate and BBEdit to end at Sublime Text as my primary text editor. The best part about Sublime Text is the keyboard-centric control it provides. Everything is a keybinding or accessible through fuzzy text matching in the command palette.
> 
> The second best thing about Sublime Text is the ludicrous number of plugins available. The SDK for Sublime Text provides enough control over the application that plugins feel like a natural part of the main program and not an add-on script. I think the great diversity in the plugins results from the multi-platform support in Sublime Text. A Sublime Text license works on Mac, Windows or Unix and many of the plugins work equally well on all three platforms.
>
> My least part of Sublime Text are the configuration files. To adjust or tweak anything requires a deep dive on a JSON file. For those looking for just a basic writing app, this is probably a deal-breaker, but for anyone that has worked in HTML, CSS or any programming language, then it's trivial. The text-based configuration files are very flexible and which means there's more control over every little detail in Sublime Text. That's a net gain in my book.
>
> I prefer medium-light text on a dark background. Many people call this "dark mode". I call it "not squinting mode." There are also ["inverted" modes](http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/26331/why-are-inverted-colors-considered-an-accessibility-feature) that some prefer. Whatever text editor you use, I recommend finding a theme that works everywhere and sticking with it, especially if there is any kind of syntax coloring. It takes the distraction out of the distraction-free writing environment.
>
> Take a look at [Colorsublime](http://colorsublime.com/) for a great collection of themes as well as an interactive demo of each. This is a seriously awesome resource.
>
> [Buy Me a Soda](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/) is a very popular theme for Sublime Text and TextMate but there are plenty of [great themes](http://kkga.github.io/spacegray/) around. Pick one and then stick with it for at least 6 months. Stop futzing with your color schemes.
> 
> There are [a few plugins I recommend](http://www.macdrifter.com/2014/01/a-sublime-writing-experience.html) for Sublime Text that make for a better writing experience. None of them are necessary. But at the very least, get comfortable with the [commands and memorize the keyboard shortcuts built](http://www.macdrifter.com/2012/08/sublime-text-shortcuts-for-writing.html) into Sublime Text. Being able to quickly jump through a document makes all the difference when working on a large block of text. I also recommend [learning how to use split panes](http://www.macdrifter.com/2012/07/sublime-text-working-with-multiple-panes.html).

Also note that even when your eventual text's destination is an email recipient or even, perish the thought, Word, you can still use the tools you have honed for plain text composition. Unless dashing off a quick note (and maybe even then), you're probably better off using what you know or prefer.

#### Gabe's Mobile Workflow
{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="8:25" }}

* [Editorial](http://omz-software.com/editorial/)
* [Nebulous Notes](http://nebulousapps.net/)
* WriteRoom for iOS [RIP](http://blog.hogbaysoftware.com/post/72442052582/winter-2014-newsletter)
* [Generational 048 - Tackling iOS Text Editors](http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/048-tackling-ios-text-editors)
* [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/)
* [Gabe's journaling article](http://www.macdrifter.com/2012/02/dayone-and-time-travel.html)

On the mobile side of the house, things are in some ways the same. Without commenting on whether the iPad is a consumption or production device, many of us do the bulk of our work on a conventional desktop or laptop. Likewise most of us do need to do some work on a mobile device, and there are many great apps that permit easy work with plain text and markdown, and Dropbox keeps it all in sync.

> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="gabe" text="Editorial" }}
>
> Editorial is the pinnacle of writing on iOS and may be one of my favorite writing tools. The singular focus of an iPad helps to enforce my intent but there's just enough flexibility in Editorial to let me quickly look something up on the web without falling down a rat hole.
>
> For the uninitiated, Editorial is a Dropbox-enabled plain text editor for the iPad. At launch, it provides a light and dark writing mode, document syncing, Dropbox powered version control, MultiMarkdown preview and a built-in web browser. But the real power of Editorial is the workflow engine that extends the application in a variety of ways. There are plenty of overviews of the application, as well as a book you can buy to learn more about the tool. But I'd recommend a few workflows to get you started:
>
> * Paste Workflow to save effort trying to trigger the pop-over
> * Select Forward and Backward by whole words
> * Find and Replace workflow
> * Smart Case conversion workflow

Another useful tip you may choos to apply is that of separating certain bits of your writing from the main body of your other work. A perfect example of this is the way that Gabe keeps his completely personal writing in DayOne. This could be a way to ensure no personal details are shared accidentally, but don't discount the mental benefit of shifting your mindset just by switching to an app that you use for only one thing.

### A Low-Volume Writer
{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="15:20" }}

* Google Reader was [powered down](http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/07/a-final-farewell.html) on July 2, 2013.
* [Generational 041 - Death and Life of RSS](http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/041-the-death-and-life-of-rss-with-alex-kessinger)

At the other end of the spectrum is semi-periodic "blogger." Erik may only [write rarely](http://themindfulbit.com/), but he does have a well considered workflow too. Consisting of the same major ingredients as Gabe, Erik's need has more of a developer's bent. In general, this workflow centers around the laptop, since the only time Erik is really unable to use his computer, he is literally mobile and isn't inclined to work at those times anyway.

### Tools We'd Like to Use
{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="22:00" }}

* Siri/iOS
* [Dragon Dictate](http://www.nuancemobilelife.com/)

{{ theme:partial src="app" show="{{ number }}" image="dragon.png" name="Dragon Dictation" description="Dragon Dictation is an easy-to-use voice recognition application powered by Dragon® NaturallySpeaking® that allows you to easily speak and instantly see your text or email messages. In fact, it’s up to five (5) times faster than typing on the keyboard." price="Free" developer="http://www.nuancemobilelife.com/"
appstore="://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dragon-dictation/id341446764?mt=8&uo=4&at=11lqk8" }}

* Android Dictation
* [Diet Coda](http://panic.com/dietcoda/)

{{ theme:partial src="app" show="{{ number }}" image="diet-coda.png" name="Diet Coda" description="What happens when you take the power of Coda, our Mac OS X web code editor, and crunch it down into a powerful, feature-packed iPad package? Introducing Diet Coda, the best way to make quick edits to your websites on the go." price="$19.99" developer="http://panic.com/dietcoda/" appstore="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/diet-coda/id500906297?mt=8&uo=4&at=11lqk8" }}

* [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php)

Many of us have aspirational tools that we really think should be perfect for *something*. Our hosts are no different in this, but if a tool is a right fit, then it will likely worm its way into your workflow rather than be denied.

### Tools We Use Without Even Thinking About Them
{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="27:12" }}

{{ theme:partial src="app" show="{{ number }}" image="textexpander.png" name="TextExpander" description="Save time and effort with TextExpander! Whether it's a simple email signature or several paragraphs of a standard response, you'll love how easy it is to use TextExpander to avoid typing the same thing over and over." price="$34.99" developer="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander" appstore="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textexpander-for-mac/id405274824?mt=12&uo=4&at=11lqk8" }}

* Discuss templates for TD
  * Time stamps
  * Asides
  * Fancy Quotes

Some workflow tools exist in the background rarely (?) needed, like a system dictionary, and some are so vital as to be a source of worry when their fate is considered, like TextExpander. For Erik it is the glue that holds his writing together, but we all fear dependency...

### Capturing Thoughts
{{ theme:partial src="timestamp" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="30:30" }}

* [Evernote](https://evernote.com/)
* [Drafts](http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/)
* [Real Paper Notes](http://doanepaper.bigcartel.com/)

Very often we need to quickly jot down an idea before it flees us, and that quick-capture muscle memory is important one to train. Drafts is without peer for the Dropbox fans, but if you don't mind have yoru note living in a database of some sort, Evernote offers a nice solution. Especially if you have an inbox notebook. It is worth pointing out that dead-tree paper is still the best choice for when you want to show that you are paying attention and not just multi-tasking.
