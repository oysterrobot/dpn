summary: >
  Gabe and Erik are joined by friend-of-the-show and new audio producer Bob VanderClay to discuss pens, paper, notebooks and why we can't seem to transition to an all-digital workflow no matter how many notebooks we throw in the wood chipper.

For Bob, it's an issue of reliability and speed. Bob sketches out software architecture, and tends to keep his notes around even though he doesn't refer to them much.

For Gabe it's about the specific problem to be solved, and planning or meeting notes still lend themselves to paper. Gabe considers his notebooks as essentially garbage, to prevent thinking about them as too precious to use. After he's done, Gabe dismantles his notebooks and scans them.

{{ theme:partial src="fancy-quote" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="7:46" person="erik" quote="Do you take the shells of your dead moleskines, dry them out and hang them on the wall as trophies?" }}

{{ theme:partial src="fancy-quote" side="right" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="7:51" person="gabe" quote="Yeah, I throw them around the yard to ward off other notebooks" }}

Bob prefers plain loose-leaf paper (no lines). Gabe likes dots on the page. Erik likes grids.

> [Field Notes](http://fieldnotesbrand.com) aren't good because they are small or because they have modestly high quality paper. They're good because I have a bunch of them and feel ok wasting pages. Having easy access to small notebooks changed the way I used paper notes. I previously coveted high end (and more expensive) hardbound notebooks and their preciousness made me conscious of how I used them. But Field Notes are available for about [$3 per notebook on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GC5QTR0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=duckwing-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B00GC5QTR0) (I like the black dot grid but many other styles are available too). These aren't the cheapest notebooks you can find, but you don't want those. They're a nice compromise between quality and quantity.
> 
> I also wholeheartedly recommend the [Field Notes wallet](http://fieldnotesbrand.com/storage/leather/) even if it is almost $90. It's my everyday wallet and like anything good, changed some of my thinking for the better. I greatly reduced what I carried in my wallet because it has fewer pockets than a regular wallet. I also now have a notebook with me everywhere I go which means it's pretty easy to scribble any idea at any time. It's my spiritual successor to the DayRunner of days gone by.

> I've been a fan of [Yafa Pens](http://www.yafa.com) from the time I could afford to buy a fountain pen. I hung out in a stationery store and played with the fountain pens for over a year before I saved up enough money to buy my first **good** pen and I still chose a Yafa. It was heavy and silver and wrote like it was dispensing buttered oil. This was in the mid eighties, shortly after Yafa started. It was a new brand but I was inexperienced and just knew it felt great. I still have that pen.

> The Fisher Space Pen is once again popular amongst the nerds. It's gone through many periods of acceptance but it's always been a great go-to pen for throwing in a glovebox or desk drawer. My new favorite variation is the [Titanium Nitride](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HLD7ZC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=duckwing-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B000HLD7ZC) with a [black metal clip](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014M0AO4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=duckwing-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=B0014M0AO4). This pairs perfectly with the Field Notes wallet.

There are still some real concerns about feel and friction.
