For Bob, it's an issue of reliability and speed. Bob sketches out software architecture, and tends to keep his notes around even though he doesn't refer to them much.

For Gabe it's about the specific problem to be solved, and planning or meeting notes still lend themselves to paper. Gabe considers his notebooks as essentially garbage, to prevent thinking about them as too precious to use. After he's done, Gabe dismantles his notebooks and scans them.

Bob prefers plain loose-leaf paper (no lines). Gabe likes dots on the page. Erik likes grids.
