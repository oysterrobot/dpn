Erik tries to dig into the history of Gabe's networking closet. How did he decide to build his own, and why?

Gabe thinks you should install vents at the top and bottom of your network closet if feasible for ventilation.

Having a network closet means you can put all your noisy devices in the same room and still keep the room quiet enough to record in.

{{ theme:partial src="section-header" title="What's in there?" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="5:04" }}

* 8-bay 1813+ Synology with seven drives
* Mac Mini
* 24 port Network Switch
* Network-based Printer Scanner
* Toolbox and Cables
* 3 UPS

Nobody touches Gabe's Network Toolbox.

* Independent power circuit
* Stays cool since it's partially underground
* Uses slatted doors

{{ theme:partial src="fancy-quote" url="{{ soundcloudurl }}" time="14:33" person="gabe" quote="I kept them to menace the other drives" }}

* Backup drives
* Thermaltake BlackX Duet 
* 3U Rack
* Boxes for resale

Erik needs a network closet, but his office is on one end of his house and doesn't have one. Long cable runs aren't a real problem for Ethernet, but it can be nice to co-locate your network closet and your primary workspace if possible.
