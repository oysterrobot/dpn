> At the end of [Technical Difficulties 67](http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/067-authoring-ibooks-with-david-sparks) with [David Sparks](http://twitter.com/macsparky) as guest, Gabe ressurected a [Generational](http://www.70decibels.com/generational/) feature he calls "Tell Me About Something You Like." In it, Gabe [told the rest of us](http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/067-authoring-ibooks-with-david-sparks#tgatj) about a great book he had just finished.
> 
> His description was such that I made it my next audiobook, and Erik too read it on his Kindle. Well, it turns out that [the author herself heard the mention](https://twitter.com/helenewecker/status/441344873304571904) and after Gabe saw this, he was able to arrange this interview.
> 
> Though we were all a bit starstruck, Helene was a gracious and wonderful guest on the show. We think you'll agree.

> ### HARDWARE ###
> 
> **[MacBook Pro with Retina display, 16GB mem, 2.8 GHz processor, 500GB storage](http://store.apple.com/us/buy-mac/macbook-pro)**  
> I treated myself to a new MacBook Pro back in December. I'd been saving up  for a while, but I waited until they announced the new line. My old laptop was a five-year-old plain vanilla MacBook, and it was running on borrowed time. For the new one, I maxed out the memory and the processor, but not the storage. Now that I've decided to go paperless, I'm wondering if that was the best decision.
> 
> **[24-inch Samsung monitor](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00C18YUZU)**  
> Your basic monitor. It isn't the greatest at talking to the laptop; when it wakes up it cycles through its analog and HDMI inputs before it hits "Digital" and finally connects. I'm sure there's some setting in its frustratingly Byzantine menu that fixes this, I just can't be bothered to find it. I certainly don't think you *need* an external monitor in order to write, but it does make it easier to look at research while writing, or two versions of a manuscript side by side.
> 
> **[MyPassport 1TB USB drive](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EAS8MWQ)**  
> Mainly I use this for Time Machine. I recently had to buy a new one, when my bad habit of unplugging without ejecting caught up with me. Turns out the warning's there for a reason. Huh.
> 
> **[2TB Drobo](http://www.drobo.com/)**  
> Our family NAS is an eight-year-old Drobo that sits on a shelf in the family room, behind my daughter's board books. We use it as our media storage (connected to our TV via a Mac Mini) but I also back up to it sporadically. (I need to be more diligent about that, probably with the help of SuperDuper.) We've had a couple of bad-drive scares, but it's still chugging along. We'd like to buy a new one soon, if only because this one's making a noise like a lawnmower. Could be the pound's worth
> of cat hair in the fan.
> 
> ### WRITING APPS ###
> 
> **[Scrivener](http://literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php)**  
> I said this in the show too, but it bears repeating: I don't know how I could've written THE GOLEM AND THE JINNI without Scrivener. That book had at least a dozen moving parts, and Scrivener allowed me to treat them as exactly that: parts that I could move around, swap in and out, try out different versions of, banish to a "graveyard" folder and later resurrect if I felt like it. I bought Scrivener in '06 or '07, back when it wasn't quite so feature-rich. I'm sort of glad I did; I know
> that Scrivener's current complexity can scare away potential users, and I might have been one of them.  Suffice to say, if you're a writer and MS Word's pissing you off, give Scrivener a try.
> 
> **[Byword](http://bywordapp.com/)**  
> I've just started using Byword, mostly on my laptop but sometimes on my iPad. I use it mostly for short-to-midlength pieces (like this one) and sometimes for long emails. I really like the stripped-down aesthetic. I've started teaching myself Markdown, so the Preview option gets a workout.
> 
> **[Simplenote](http://simplenote.com/)**  
> In the past I've rotated between Notational Velocity, NVAlt, and Simplenote, and right now Simplenote's on top. I'm pretty happy with it, though I miss Notational Velocity's nifty "search and create from the same line" feature. I used to keep *everything* I wrote (that wasn't part of a book) in Simplenote, including the short-to-midlength pieces I now write in Byword. But that started to get unwieldy, and it gunked up the search results. Now I use Simplenote mostly for lists, reference
> info that I need to access quickly and often, and travel itineraries. The sync to iOS is pretty reliable; I've had my grocery list decouple a few times, I suspect because I had it open and edited in both devices. So now I keep a template, just in case.
> 
> ###OUTLINING###
> 
> **[Tree](http://www.topoftree.jp/en/tree/)**  
> I started playing around with Tree while I was outlining the new book. I like it quite a bit, though some of the actions don't behave the I want them to, so they don't stick in my muscle memory as well as I'd like. The horizontal view is fabulous for looking at a lot of info on the screen at once. Weirdly, I use Tree to write presentations instead of Scrivener, which would be the more obvious choice. I think my brain has partitioned off Scrivener for writing fiction; doing
> anything else in the app just feels odd.
> 
> **[OmniOutliner](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner)**  
> I used to use OmniOutliner back in the days of Kinkless GTD, but I never really got familiar with the app itself, and that's something I'd like to change. Too many people have recommended it not to use it. I've tried at least twice to get to know the latest version, and each time I've retreated back to Tree, a victim of the exact same feature overwhelm that keeps a lot of writers away from Scrivener. Ridiculous, I know. I love everything the Omni folks do, and eventually I'll get
> there.
> 
> **[Aeon Timeline](http://www.scribblecode.com/index.html)**  
> Oh man, do I wish Aeon Timeline had been around eight years ago. AT lets you create incredibly complex but easily readable timelines, along decades or years or even minutes. (Scifi and fantasy writers, check out the feature that lets you define non-Earth-standard time increments!) You can organize your events along different "arcs," which is incredibly helpful if you want to keep groups of events separate from each other, but still want to see where they intersect. For my next
> book, I've built a timeline with different arcs for events from World War I, New York history, the lives of various historical figures (Ameen Rihani, Louis Brandeis, T.E. Lawrence, etc.), and the lives of my own characters. So when I go to actually write the book, I can be clear on which real-world events have already happened, which will happen within the course of the book (and possibly influence the characters' actions or attitudes), and which events the characters will create
> themselves in the course of the plot. If this sounds confusing, just take a look at the demo, where they've broken down the entire plot of *Murder on the Orient Express.* It took me about a half hour of playing with AT to go from "Hmm, it's a little pricey" to "SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY."  
> 
> ### EMAIL ###
> 
> **[Gmail (in browser)](https://mail.google.com)**  
> Am I weird for using Gmail in the browser? Everyone else seems to use Apple Mail or MailMate or what have you. I've tried them all, but I always end up back in Chrome. (Though once a week I open up Apple Mail and let it slurp down all the new stuff, just so I've got everything in storage.) Of course, my email needs are relatively uncomplicated: I've only got one account to manage, and I don't have to worry about syncing with an Outlook server or the like. 
> 
> That said, I've experienced a lot of growing pains around email in the last few years. It wasn't too long ago that I'd get maybe six emails I cared about in the course of a working day. These days, I have a lot to respond to, much of it time-sensitive. I'm still trying to figure out how to manage it all. I set up a bunch of filters set up to move low-priority email to a "Later" folder, so that (hopefully) the most important emails float to the top, but I don't entirely trust it yet. I
> tried the SaneBox demo, but I'm too much of a control freak to be happy with it. I kept second-guessing the algorithm, and wondering what I wasn't seeing. Maybe someday I'll be able to let go (and justify the annual fee), but for now I'll keep struggling with email on my own.
> 
> ###RESEARCH###
> 
> **[Scrivener](http://literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) again**  
> I didn't keep any research in Scrivener while writing THE GOLEM AND THE JINNI. Instead I stuck it all in Evernote, and went back and forth. But for the next book, I've been loading everything into Scrivener's research folder instead. It was just too irritating to switch between apps, especially when I'd start to second-guess myself over some historical detail: "Wait, did I really read this somewhere, or did I make it up?" And then I'd have to switch to Evernote and dig out
> the right note. Whereas if everything is in Scrivener, I can link from the draft in progress to the right document in the research folder. Once and done. 
> 
> Granted, it's much more of a pain to get everything into Scrivener. The Evernote folks have gone out of their way to give you 17 different ways to toss content into your notebooks, but with Scrivener it has to be done from inside the app. There's probably some way to use Hazel rules and AppleScript to save items into a Dropbox folder and then automatically load them into a predetermined Scrivener document, but learning AppleScript isn't high enough on my priority list to figure it
> out. Rumor has it that Literature & Latte is working on an iOS version of Scrivener, which I'd really love to see. Might give me a reason to use my iPad more often.
> 
> **[Evernote](https://evernote.com/)**  
> I have a love-hate relationship with Evernote. Sometimes it's invaluable, and sometimes it feels like a junk closet. Admittedly, I'm not the best at keeping it organized. Recently I went through it and created a handful of new notebooks; hopefully that'll help. But part of the problem is that Evernote has really fuzzy boundaries, and ends up half-sharing the duties I use a lot of other apps for. Should I keep my to-read articles in Evernote, or in Instapaper? What about small but
> important pieces of reference info: Evernote, or Simplenote? Recipes are a no-brainer, but what about articles on time- or event-sensitive subjects, like tax advice or seasonal gardening tips? Do I create OmniFocus reminders for those, or make an Evernote "tickler" notebook a la GTD? It leads to muddy workflows and duplication of effort. Sometimes I'll do a Google search on something and toss the results into Evernote, only to see I'd already clipped that article a year ago. It's
> like buying a new lightbulb, and then finding a blister pack of them hidden in the linen closet.
> 
> **[PDFPen](http://smilesoftware.com/PDFpen/index.html) and the [Fujitsu ScanSnap ix500](http://www.fujitsu.com/us/services/computing/peripherals/scanners/scansnap/scansnap-iX500.html)**  
> I stuck these two together because they really are a team: together, they're twice as useful as they would be alone. Since a lot of my research involves stuff like out-of-print books, old maps, and articles from academic journals, I end up making a lot of photocopies. This used to lead to entire shelves devoted to three-ring binders. Now that I have the ScanSnap and PDFPen, I'm turning it all digital. It's all on my laptop, right where I need it, and easily searchable.
> 
> 
> ###PRODUCTIVITY###
> 
> **[OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus)**   
> It's probably an exaggeration to say I'd be lost without OmniFocus, but not by much. I'm still (perpetually) refining my OF workflows. I used to keep separate folders for work projects, travel, and home or personal projects, regardless of whether they were short-term or ongoing. Now, as soon as a project gets a deadline, it goes in the Deadlines folder, no matter which part of my life it comes from. That way I can scan the folder quickly to see what I've got coming down
> the pike. I don't want to have to look in two different places to realize that I've got a blog Q&A due the same day I'm hosting a Passover seder. 
> 
> Like a lot of OF users, I struggle with how -- or even whether -- to break down large creative projects into OmniFocus tasks. It would feel weird *not* to have my next book represented in OF in some way, since it's the biggest thing on my plate. But at least with the last book, once I was in the thick of writing, a daily repeating OF task labeled "Write two hours" seemed kind of silly. Kind of like having a task called "Eat lunch" or "Put your clothes on." What the hell else was I going
> to do that day? So right now, my next-book OF project only has a few ancillary tasks in it, like "Research NYC orphanages in 1910s," and "Go to UC Berkeley library for JSTOR access." Maybe as I (hopefully) acquire an official deadline and the book gains substance and momentum, I'll figure out a good way to break it down into trackable chunks.
> 
> N.B.: I can't remember which productivity blogger or podcaster suggested creating app-based contexts ("@Chrome," "@Byword," and so on) but whoever it was, I owe you big. It changed my entire workflow. Now I just open an app, go through my task list, and then move on to the next app. Genius.
> 
> **[Freedom](http://macfreedom.com/)**  
> There are days when turning on Freedom is the only way I get anything done. It's painful, especially when I'm in research mode or waiting for a response to an email. But still, invaluable. 
> 
> **[RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/)**
> I've started using RescueTime again, now that I'm trying to get back into Serious Writing Mode. It keeps me accountable over the long term, the same way that Freedom does over the short term. And it's always fun to try to beat yesterday's stats.
> 
> 
> ###AUTOMATION/SHORTCUTS###
> 
> **[Hazel](http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php)**  
> I finally bought Hazel about a month ago, after hearing everyone talk about it ad nauseam. I've barely scratched the surface of what it can do, but already it's saving me tons of time and mental energy. Moreover, Hazel makes me think about how I label my documents upfront, instead of what I used to do: just call them any old thing and toss them in a giant bucket. It's helping me create an in-the-moment organizational discipline that, with any luck, will spill  over into other aspects of my
> life. 
> 
> **[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/)**  
> Oh, Alfred, how I neglect you. I know you're more than just an app switcher and document finder. Others whisper amazing things about your clipboard prowess, but do I take the time to figure you out? No, I just tell you to open iTunes again. Poor Alfred.
> 
> **[TextExpander](https://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html)**  
> I've been tinkering with TextExpander for a few months, figuring out where the big wins are. At first I created a zillion snippets for small, often-used phrases, but I found it was more effort to remember the snippet than to just type out the phrase. Now I'm much more interested in long-form snippets. Recently I figured out how to use TextExpander snippets to write answers to frequently asked questions. I tend to answer the same dozen or so questions repeatedly, either in email interviews
> or in readers' emails. I wanted a way to speed up the process, but I didn't want to copy and paste canned responses. So I developed a set of snippets that present me with lists of phrases related to each answer. For instance, if someone asks about my inspiration for THE GOLEM AND THE JINNI, I type ".inspiration" and get this:
> 
> > started at Columbia   
> working on short stories   
> combined tales from families   
> immigration to America  
> issues of language, culture   
> collection refused    
> complained to a friend    
> she pointed out  
> realist stories  
> sci-fi and fantasy  
> challenged me  
> fantastical instead  
> switched characters  
> golem and jinni   
> 
> Now I have a handy cheat-sheet of phrases. I can incorporate them straight into my answer, or reword and tinker with them, or just read them over to get the engine going and then write something completely different. This way I can to tailor each response to fit the situation (relaxed-and-chatty blog Q&A vs. more formal press interview, etc.) without having to start each answer over again from square one.
> 
> ###BUDGETING###
> 
> **[You Need a Budget (YNAB)](http://www.youneedabudget.com/)**
> This doesn't have to do with writing per se, but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention YNAB. I'm essentially a freelancer now, so I get paid in erratically spaced, odd-sized chunks. That means I need serious control over my monthly expenses, so I can build a cushion for myself and have some certainty about how long it'll last. And then there's the joy of quarterly taxes, saving for retirement, tickets home for the holidays, etc. It didn't happen overnight, but with YNAB's help, I've managed to
> create a realistic, all-inclusive budget and stick to it, for the first time in my life. Frankly, it feels pretty great.
> 


> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="gabe" text="On Being a Writer" }}
>
> One of my favorite aspects of this interview was the obvious dichotomy of becoming a professional writer. Anyone can become a "real" writer and professional story teller, but not just anyone has the tenacity and professionalism to make it a career. I think Helene is a character study in the birth of a professional writer. She gave up a lucrative career, worked very hard at perfeting her craft, and stuck with it until someone noticed.
>
> While I do believe that it takes talent to be a professional writer, I think Helene's story is compeling because of her fortitude and persistence in achieving that status. It's fun, but it sure is a lot of hard work too.



> {{ theme:partial src="aside-header" voice="gabe" text="SciFi and Fantasy" }}
>
> Science fiction and fantasy has gotten a bad rap over the years. For a long time it was second class to works by authors that focused solely on the human condition, like Hemingway and Fitzgerald. I made my way to the genre through Vonnegut, who elegantly intertwined time travel and alien planets with alcoholism and suicide. It was a surprise when I learned that fiction and scifi were two separate things.
> With the popularity of vampire stories and comic book movies, I think the mainstream is steadily moving toward my own happy conclusion: SciFi is just fiction with an imagination.
