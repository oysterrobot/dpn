summary: >
  Dr. Drang returns to explore his
  background in computing from the late
  1970s to today. Along the way we
  discover what happens when you mess up a
  punchcard, what Linux was like in the
  early days, why he uses a Mac today, and
  his perspectives on the near future of
  computing.

* Really started in college in highschool, computers were tied up with data entry. More Vo-tech
* First exposure to coimputers was FORTRAN as an intro to programming
* [Keypunch Machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keypunch_machine)

*** aside on how punched card worked ***

Wikipedia has a [thorough write up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card) of the IBM style punched cards.

### types of programming
- loops and bobby on motorcycle blowing up
- not excited by computers for the sake of computers. Learned in isolation.
- Took Pascal course as technical elective which was how he learned programming 
27+39
- procedures vs functions
- s (???)
- linked lists, doubly-linked lists
- wrote text editor

["Dogfooding"](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115349/dogfooding-tech-slang-working-out-glitches) is an expression that has risen to popular culture out of nerd culture at Microsoft and generally means using your own creation for real work and not just as a QA target. The expression represents something that is fairly commonplace now in software development. Dogfooding can often reveal bugs and awkward interactions models that scripted testing may not.

- LINK dogfooding
- wrote text editor as capstone
- LINK "why pascal is not my favorite language"
- first program as a tool as graduate school--reliability calculation
- explaining to a computer in a program, changed the way he taught it.
- LINK blogging technical solutions

> My first computer was a calculator. It was a [Texas Instruments TI-74](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-74) pocket computer. It was hard to call it a computer even then. But it was programmable using BASIC and it was the first time I could write down logic and have it repeatedly executed with different input. It was a computer.
> 
> Programming that little piece of plastic was not fun. It displayed one line at a time and forget any reasonable stack trace. But it made me think and plan my programs carefully because for that exact reason. Dumb mistakes were even less fun than now.


### Home computing
- commodore 64 
- 1985 fat mac looked like space man--fostered love of computers
- LINK Bloom County
- multitasking - programs inserted "break points"
- kernel extensions
- unstable
- Apple wanted to buy a company (NeXT in the end) made him think that 
- LINK os 10.0 date
- Unix philosophy (otw, pipes, etc.)
- 1996 Linux
- Redhat Linux
ASIDE my first Linux, "Dummies" book, made binders, etc.
- packages and package managers
