While we've already [delved](http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/005-the-future-of-books) a [bit](http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/067-authoring-ibooks-with-david-sparks) into books of one sort before, reading is a subject that can take a conversation in any direction. For people of a certain generation, reading often connotes a book of one sort or another, but the 80s generation may be the last to make that connection. With the ever increasing popularity of hand-held computers, you no longer have to know *what* you want to read, only *that* you want to read. Gone is the requirement to distinctly pick up a novel, history (chemistry?) book, or magazine.

Reading on the web used to be as simple as opening up [Google Reader](http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/07/a-final-farewell.html) and browsing through your (thousands) of feeds, but the RSS landsacape is a little less clear right now.

I chose a fourth option by quitting RSS altogether. I may go back someday, but for right now, I visit a handful of sites manually (while carefully avoiding [others](http://www.theverge.com/) and haven't missed any big news yet. I do continue to miss subtweets, however...

What the RSS market comes down to now, really, is selecting a client and then adding in the feed syncing afterward. All of the top Reader replacements have easy [OPML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML) import and export, and all of the top clients support multiple sync services. This is a pretty sane way to operate overall, but a little more innovation wouldn't hurt either.

Whether using Feedbin in the browser or just reading a site in place on its server, reading a blog with its intended styling does have its own merit too. This way you can enjoy the hard work that designers put into the presentation of their words, while also enjoying the various shades of green they employ. In any event Fluid is still the finest implementation of [site-specific browsing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site-specific_browser) there is.

While reading on the web, it is easy to come accross something you would like to save for later reference or for later reading. Bookmarks have [long existed](http://www.w3.org/News/9305.html) to satisfy both needs, but features like offline access and improved mobile presentation brought read-it-later services into common use. Instapaper was [(arguably?)](http://www.marco.org/2013/02/21/the-first-read-later-service) the first of these services, but many great options exist now.
